# Roobish

A nostalgic, RNG-free, stadium battle game-type-thing.

Roobish is a cross between Pokemon, Hearthstone, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2, Turbo Tax 2008, and Roobish. It's free-to-play, browser-based, and several other hyphenated things.

# Story

On May 15th, 2015, 32-year-old IT worker Jacob Bonner was struck in the head by an unopened can of Mr. Pibb, causing a small rift to form inside his brain. From that moment on, every thought that passed through his mind was sucked into the rift and instantly transported 300,000,000 light-years across space, ending up on the planet of Roobish where the thought manifested itself into physical form. The native Roobites gathered around the portals from which these thought-monsters emerged, and did what any rational life form would do under such circumstances: They enslaved the monsters and pitted them against one another in arena-style combat. As for Jacob, he walked away from the incident with nothing more than a bump on his noggin and a tasty beverage in his hand, entirely unaware of the alien sport that was now fueled by his imagination.
